"1","ECO: A Generic Eutrophication Model Including Comprehensive Sediment-Water Interaction","10.1371/journal.pone.0068104","23844160","101285081","4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","1932-6203,","PLOS ONE","The content and calibration of the comprehensive generic 3D eutrophication model ECO for water and sediment quality is presented. Based on a computational grid for water and sediment, ECO is used as a tool for water quality management to simulate concentrations and mass fluxes of nutrients (N, P, Si), phytoplankton species, detrital organic matter, electron acceptors and related substances. ECO combines integral simulation of water and sediment quality with sediment diagenesis and closed mass balances. Its advanced process formulations for substances in the water column and the bed sediment were developed to allow for a much more dynamic calculation of the sediment-water exchange fluxes of nutrients as resulting from steep concentration gradients across the sediment-water interface than is possible with other eutrophication models. ECO is to more accurately calculate the accumulation of organic matter and nutrients in the sediment, and to allow for more accurate prediction of phytoplankton biomass and water quality in response to mitigative measures such as nutrient load reduction. ECO was calibrated for shallow Lake Veluwe (The Netherlands). Due to restoration measures this lake underwent a transition from hypertrophic conditions to moderately eutrophic conditions, leading to the extensive colonization by submerged macrophytes. ECO reproduces observed water quality well for the transition period of ten years. The values of its process coefficients are in line with ranges derived from literature. ECO's calculation results underline the importance of redox processes and phosphate speciation for the nutrient return fluxes. Among other things, the results suggest that authigenic formation of a stable apatite-like mineral in the sediment can contribute significantly to oligotrophication of a lake after a phosphorus load reduction.","pubmed","1720380",NA,NA,2,2,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1.85,11,0,0,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0068104",1377866559,1372806000,"science,medicine,","Medicine, Health Sciences, Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology, Life Sciences, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, ",1392035973,11,"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=1720380",NA

Effects of physiological maturation (during normal brain development) and proficiency on tasks requiring complex visuospatial processing have not yet been studied extensively, as they are almost invariably interrelated. We therefore aimed at dissociating the effects of age and performance on functional MRI (fMRI) activation in a complex visual search task. In our cross-sectional study, healthy children and adolescents (n = 43, 19 females, 7-17 years) performed a complex visual search task during fMRI. Resulting activation was analysed with regard to the differential effects of age and performance. Our results are compatible with an increase in the neural network's efficacy with age: within occipital and parietal cortex, the core regions of the visual exploration network, activation increased with age, and more so in the right than in the left hemisphere. Further, activation outside the visual search network decreased with age, mainly in left inferior frontal, middle temporal, and inferior parietal cortex. High-performers had stronger activation in right superior parietal cortex, suggesting a more mature visual search network. We could not see effects of age or performance in frontal cortex. Our results show that effects of physiological maturation and effects of performance, while usually intertwined, can be successfully disentangled and investigated using fMRI in children and adolescents.","pubmed","2001416",NA,NA,2,2,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0.5,1,0,0,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0085168",1387847493,1387756800,"science,medicine,","Medicine, Health Sciences, Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology, Life Sciences, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, ",1387922070,1,"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=2001416",NA

In order to investigate the relationship between MSI and Gallid herpesvirus 2 (GaHV-2)-induced lymphoma, fifteen Marek's disease (MD) lymphomas were analyzed through using 46 microsatellite markers, which were amplified by PCR from DNA specimens of lymphoma and normal muscular tissues from the same chicken. PCR products were evaluated by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for MSI analysis. MSI was proved in all lymphomas, at least in one locus. Thirty of the 46 microsatellite markers had microsatellite alterations.

The nasopharynxes of children are believed to be the natural reservoir of pneumococcus and by adulthood nasopharyngeal carriage is infrequent; such infrequency may be due to demonstrable pneumococcal specific T and B-cell responses. HLA Class 2 tetrameric complexes have been used to characterise antigen specific T-cell responses in a variety of models of infection. We therefore sought to determine the frequency and phenotype of pneumococcal specific T-cells, using a novel HLA-DRB1*1501 tetramer complex incorporating a recently defined T-cell epitope derived from the conserved pneumococcal serine/threonine kinase (StkP). We were able to detect direct ex-vivo StkP(446-60)-tetramer binding in HLA-DRB1*1501 adults. These StkP(446-60)-tetramer binding T-cells had increased CD38 expression and were enriched in CCR7- CD45RA+ expression indicating recent and on-going activation and differentiation. Furthermore, these StkP(446-60)-tetramer binding T-cells demonstrated rapid effector function by secreting interferon-gamma on stimulation with recombinant StkP. This is the first study to directly enumerate and characterise pneumococcal specific T-cells using HLA class 2 tetrameric complexes. We found that ex-vivo pneumococcal-specific T cells were detectable in healthy adults and that they were enriched with cell surface markers associated with recent antigen exposure and later stages of antigen-driven differentiation. It is likely that these activated pneumococcal specific T-cells reflect recent immunostimulatory pneumococcal exposure in the nasopharynx and it is possible that they may be preventing subsequent colonisation and disease.","pubmed",NA,NA,NA,1,1,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0.25,3,0,2,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0025367",1319491785,1319410800,"science,medicine,","Medicine, Health Sciences, Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology, Life Sciences, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, ",1319490123,5,"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=426992","2011ploso...6e5367a"

"6","Sex Promotes Spatial and Dietary Segregation in a Migratory Shorebird during the Non-Breeding Season","10.1371/journal.pone.0033811","22479448","101285081","4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","1932-6203,","PLoS ONE","Several expressions of sexual segregation have been described in animals, especially in those exhibiting conspicuous dimorphism. Outside the breeding season, segregation has been mostly attributed to size or age-mediated dominance or to trophic niche divergence. Regardless of the recognized implications for population dynamics, the ecological causes and consequences of sexual segregation are still poorly understood. We investigate the foraging habits of a shorebird showing reversed sexual dimorphism, the black-tailed godwit Limosa limosa, during the winter season, and found extensive segregation between sexes in spatial distribution, microhabitat use and dietary composition. Males and females exhibited high site-fidelity but differed in their distributions at estuary-scale. Male godwits (shorter-billed) foraged more frequently in exposed mudflats than in patches with higher water levels, and consumed more bivalves and gastropods and fewer polychaetes than females. Females tended to be more frequently involved and to win more aggressive interactions than males. However, the number of aggressions recorded was low, suggesting that sexual dominance plays a lesser role in segregation, although its importance cannot be ruled out. Dimorphism in the feeding apparatus has been used to explain sex differences in foraging ecology and behaviour of many avian species, but few studies confirmed that morphologic characteristics drive individual differences within each sex. We found a relationship between resource use and bill size when pooling data from males and females. However, this relationship did not hold for either sex separately, suggesting that differences in foraging habits of godwits are primarily a function of sex, rather than bill size. Hence, the exact mechanisms through which this segregation operates are still unknown. The recorded differences in spatial distribution and resource use might expose male and female to distinct threats, thus affecting population dynamics through differential mortality. Therefore, population models and effective conservation strategies should increasingly take sex-specific requirements into consideration.","pubmed",NA,NA,NA,2,1,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,22,0,0,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0033811",1333394724,1333062000,"science,medicine,","Medicine, Health Sciences, Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology, Life Sciences, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, ",1334131929,22,"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=677583","2012ploso...7e3811c"

However, microarray technology in cancer diagnosis or prognosis has been primarily used for the statistical evaluation of patient populations, and thus excludes inter-individual variability and patient-specific predictions. Here we propose a metric called clinical confidence that serves as a measure of prognostic reliability to facilitate the shift from population-wide to personalized cancer prognosis using microarray-based predictive models. The performance of sample-based models predicted with different clinical confidences was evaluated and compared systematically using three large clinical datasets studying the following cancers: breast cancer, multiple myeloma, and neuroblastoma. Survival curves for patients, with different confidences, were also delineated. The results show that the clinical confidence metric separates patients with different prediction accuracies and survival times. Samples with high clinical confidence were likely to have accurate prognoses from predictive models. Moreover, patients with high clinical confidence would be expected to live for a notably longer or shorter time if their prognosis was good or grim based on the models, respectively. We conclude that clinical confidence could serve as a beneficial metric for personalized cancer prognosis prediction utilizing microarrays. Ascribing a confidence level to prognosis with the clinical confidence metric provides the clinician an objective, personalized basis for decisions, such as choosing the severity of the treatment.","pubmed",NA,NA,NA,9,8,8,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,3.6,13,0,0,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0029534",1327563119,1327449600,"science,medicine,","Medicine, Health Sciences, Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology, Life Sciences, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, ",1328279683,13,"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=575057","2012ploso...7e9534s"
