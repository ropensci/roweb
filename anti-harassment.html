                <p>This anti-harassment policy applies to all events organised by rOpenSci. Some events may have additions to the policy.

    <h3>Super short version</h3>

    <p>rOpenSci is dedicated to a harassment-free event experience for everyone.<br> 


<h3>Slightly longer version</h3>

<p>rOpenSci is dedicated to providing a harassment-free event experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of event participants in any form. Event participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event at the discretion of the event organizers. <br> 


<h3>Longer version  </h3>

<p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

<p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the event organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of rOpenSci staff immediately. 

<p>Event staff will be happy to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance.

<p>We expect participants to follow these rules at all event venues and event-related social events.
