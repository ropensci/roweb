The week after labor day, we had the pleasure of attending the [NCEAS open science codefest](http://nceas.github.io/open-science-codefest/) event in Santa Barbara. It was great to meet folks like the new arrivals at the expanding [Mozilla Science Lab](http://mozillascience.org), [Bill Mills](https://twitter.com/billdoesphysics) and [Abby Cabunoc](https://twitter.com/abbycabs) (Bill even already has a great [post up about codefest](http://mozillascience.org/worries-critical-mass/)), and see old friends from NCEAS and DataONE among many more. This 2.5 day event ran smoothly thanks to the leadership of Matt Jones, and it's worth noting how projects were chosen to provide context for what we worked on. Prior to the event people [filed issues](https://github.com/NCEAS/open-science-codefest/issues), but on top of that at the beginning of the event everyone was able to give an elevator pitch for their idea (1 floor ride length :) ), and could even include ideas not posted as issues. Each idea was then posted up on a giant post it on the wall.  Then people had about 30 minutes to wander the room and sign-up to work on projects which the organizers then scheduled. The approach allowed for a consensus based filtering of ideas.  So with that in mind, here's an overview of the projects the rOpenSci team worked on and what we accomplished at the openscience codefest.

1. [rdataone](https://github.com/dataoneorg/rdataone) - t and s
2. [open science in ecology manuscript](https://etherpad.mozilla.org/osmanuscript) - t
3. [coverage extraction](https://github.com/ropensci/mdextract) - t
4. [pangear](https://github.com/ropensci/pangaear) - s
5. [datapackage](https://github.com/ropensci/datapackage) - s

Overall we had a great time, were able to begin some new projects, and contribute to some important existing ones. We hope to continue to build out what we started at codefest and integrate it into our existing tool set and work flows.
