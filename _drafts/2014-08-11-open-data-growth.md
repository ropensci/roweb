## Why open data growth

At rOpenSci we make it easier for you to use open data, and contribute your own open data to the community. The question often arises: How much is the amount of open data growing through time?

We work with more than X data sources. We asked many of them to share some data on the amount of data they have, and if possible, growth through time of their data holdings. Many of our partners came through with some data.

We collated data from the different sources, and made some pretty graphs using the data. Here's what we found:

## Amount of open data

XXXX

## Growth of open data

XXXX

## Gaps in open data

### Reproduce this

You can reproduce the data analyzed and visualized here using the gist here:
