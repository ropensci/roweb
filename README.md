Notes for the website:

* Use the `Makefile` and `make deploy` to `jekyll build`, cd to `_site`, and push to the `new` folder (i.e. `new.ropensci.org`). We can remote the new and push to main site once we are happy.
Note: Can someone fix the makefile? It doesn't cd properly before pushing.

* If adding new community members, it's best to add a square image that is 250 x 250 px. If you have issues, @karthik has Photoshop and can fix things.
