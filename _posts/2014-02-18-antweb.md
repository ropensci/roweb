Data on more than `10,000` species of ants recorded worldwide are available through from [California Academy of Sciences](http://www.calacademy.org/)' [AntWeb](http://www.antweb.org/), a repository that boasts a wealth of natural history data, digital images, and specimen records on ant species from a large community of museum curators.

Digging through some of the earliest announcements of AntWeb, I came across a Nature News piece titled __"Mashups mix data into global service"__ from January 2006. The article contains this great quote from [Roderic Page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roderic_D.M._Page) _"If you could pool data from every museum or lab in the world, you could do amazing things"_. The article also says _"So far, only researchers with advanced programming skills, working in fields organized enough to have data online and tagged appropriately, have been able to do this."_  In many ways this really is motivation for why we develop interfaces to these rich data repositories. Our express intent is to facilitate researchers explore amazing opportunities that lie within such data by lowering techinical barriers to use. Right on the heels of our most recent package ([`ecoengine`](http://ropensci.org/blog/2014/01/30/ecoengine/)), we are now happy to first release of an interface to  [AntWeb](http://www.antweb.org/). 

A stable version of our R package [AntWeb](http://ropensci.org/AntWeb.html) is now available from CRAN. The API currently does not require a key for access  but larger requests will be throttled on the server side. It is worth noting that much of these same data are also ported through the Global Biodiversity Information Facility and accessible through our [`gbif`](http://ropensci.org/rgbif.html) package. This package provides a more direct interface to more of the ant specific natural history data.

## Installing the package




A stable version of the package (`0.5`) is now available on CRAN. 


```r
install.packages("AntWeb")  
```

or you can install the latest development version (the master branch is also always stable & deployable and most up-to-date. Current version is `0.5.3` at the time of this writing).


```r
library(devtools)  
install_github("ropensci/AntWeb")
```


## Searching through the database  
As with most of our packages, there are several ways to search through an API. In the case of AntWeb, you can search by a genus or full species name or by other taxonomic ranks like sub-phylum.

__Data on ants__  

To obtain data on any taxonomic group, you can make a request using the `aw_data()` function. It's possible to search easily by a taxonomic rank (e.g. a genus) or by passing a complete scientific name.

__Searching by Genus__  


```r
library(AntWeb)
# To get data on an ant genus found widely through Central and South America
data_genus_only <- aw_data(genus = "acanthognathus")
leaf_cutter_ants  <- aw_data(genus = "acromyrmex")
unique(leaf_cutter_ants$meta.species)
```

```

#> [29] "nobilis"      "octospinosus" "pubescens"    "pulvereus"   
#> [33] "rugosus"      "santschii"    "silvestrii"   "striatus"    
#> [37] "subterraneus" "versicolor"   "volcanus"
```



__Searching by species__  


```r
# You can request data on any particular species
acanthognathus_df <- aw_data(scientific_name = "acanthognathus brevicornis")
head(acanthognathus_df)
```

```

```

```r
# You can also limit queries to observation records that have been geoferenced
acanthognathus_df_geo <- aw_data(genus = "acanthognathus", species = "brevicornis", georeferenced = TRUE)
```
It's also possible to search for records around any location by specifying a search radius.

```r
data_by_loc <- aw_coords(coord = "37.76,-122.45", r = 2)
# This will search for data on a 2 km radius around that latitude/longitude
```


__Image data__

Most specimens in the database have images associated with them. These include high, medium, and low resolution version of the head, dorsal side, full profile, and the specimen label. For example we can retrieve data on a specimen of _Ecitoninaeeciton burchellii_ with the following call:


```r
# Data and images for Ecitoninaeeciton burchellii
eb <- aw_code("casent0003205")
eb$image_data$high[[2]]
```

```
#> [1] "http://www.antweb.org/images/casent0003205/casent0003205_h_1_high.jpg"
```


If you're primarily interested in ant images and would like to keep up with recent additions to the database, you can also use the `aw_images` function. This function takes two arguments: `since`, the number of days to search backward, and a `type`. Possible options for type are `h` for head, `d` for dorsal, `p` for profile, and `l` for label. If a type is not specified, all available images are retrieved.


```r
# Retrieve only dorsal images for the last five days
aw_images(since = 5, type = "d")
```


It's also possible to retrieve unique lists of any taxonomic rank using the `aw_unique` function.


```r
subfamily_list <- aw_unique(rank = "subfamily")
nrow(subfamily_list)
```

```
#> [1] 69
```

```r
head(subfamily_list)  
```

```
#>       subfamily
#> 1      (apidae)
#> 2  (bethylidae)
#> 3  (braconidae)
#> 4   (cynipidae)
#> 5  (diapriidae)
#> 6 (diaspididae)
```

```r
genus_list <- aw_unique(rank = "genus")
nrow(genus_list)
```

```
#> [1] 470
```

```r
head(genus_list)  
```

```
#>             genus
#> 1    (aenictinae)
#> 2 (amblyoponinae)
#> 3        (apidae)
#> 4        (attini)
#> 5  (basicerotini)
#> 6    (bethylidae)
```

```r
species_list <- aw_unique(rank = "species")
nrow(species_list)
```

```
#> [1] 10480
```

```r
head(species_list)  
```

```
#>          species
#> 1 (basicerotini)
#> 2        (indet)
#> 3       (indet.)
#> 4    (orizabanum
#> 5     abbreviata
#> 6     abdelazizi
```


If you work with existing specimens, you can also query directly by a specimen ID.


```r
asphinctanilloides_amazona <- aw_code(code = "casent0104669")
# This will return a list with a metadata data.frame and a image data.frame
```


If you have a multiple specimen IDs, as is often the case when working with research data, you can get data on all of them at the same time. The function automatically retuns `NULL` values when no data are found and you can have these removed using `plyr::compact` (this happens automatically when you use a function call like `ldply`.)


```r
specimens <- c("casent0908629", "casent0908650", "casent0908637")
results <- lapply(specimens, function(x) aw_code(x))
names(results) <- specimens
length(results)
```

```
#> [1] 3
```


## Mapping ant specimen data  

As with the previous ecoengine package, you can also visualize location data for any set of species. Adding `georeferenced = TRUE` to a data retrieval call will filter out any data points without location information. Once retrieved the data are mapped with the open source [Leaflet.js](http://leafletjs.com/) and pushed to your default browser. Maps and associated `geoJSON` files are also saved to a location specified (or defaults to your `/tmp` folder). This feature is only available on the development version on GitHub (`0.5.2` or greater; see above on how to install) and will be available from CRAN in version `0.6`


```r
acd <- aw_data(genus = "acanthognathus")
aw_map(acd)
```

## Integration with the rest of our biodiversity suite  

Our newest package on CRAN, [`spocc`](https://github.com/ropensci/spocc) (Species Occurrence Data), currently in review at CRAN, integrates `AntWeb` among other sources. More details on `spocc` in our next blog post.

As always please send [suggestions, bug reports, and ideas](https://github.com/ropensci/AntWeb/issues/new) related to the AntWeb R package directly to our repo.
